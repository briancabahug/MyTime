# Ticket 3: Generate Hive Adapters
Priority: HIGH
Estimated Time: 15 minutes

## Description
Use build_runner to generate Hive adapter code for data persistence.

## Tasks

  - Ensure all model files have part 'filename.g.dart'; directive
  - Run flutter pub run build_runner build command
  - Verify .g.dart files are generated for each model
  - Check for any build errors and fix if necessary
  - Add .g.dart files to git (they're required for the app to run)
  -
Acceptance Criteria

  - Build runner completes successfully
  - All model files have corresponding .g.dart files
  - No compilation errors
  - Generated files contain adapter code

Notes
If build_runner fails, check:

  - All part directives are correct
  - No syntax errors in model files
  - All Hive annotations are properly closed

Common fix: flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
